                <p>This year I have been on the inside of one of the most love-filled companies in the UK (fun fact: ðŸ˜¯ Nando's is <i>also</i> the biggest importer of Halloumi in the UK)</p>
                <p>Red Badger are working in-house with Nandoâ€™s to design a customer ordering journey, and integrate it into their current app. </p>

                  <h3>Problem</h3>
                  <p>Nandoâ€™s are currently supporting multiple platforms for engagement with their customers: the Brand website <a href="https://nandos.co.uk" target="_blank">nandos.co.uk</a>, the Takeaway and Delivery website <a href="https://nandos.co.uk" target="_blank">get.nandos</a>, and the native app. If a customer wishes to place an order and begins the journey inside the app, they are currently redirected to the responsive web ordering journey.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
      
            <div class="col-lg-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <div class="process p-3">

                <div>
                  <span class="flaticon-vector display-4 text-primary mb-4 d-inline-block"></span>
                  <h3>Action</h3>
                  <p>We are using <strong>agile principles</strong> to deliver value into the hands of customers early and focusing on an </strong>MDP</strong> - the thinnest slice of releasable functionality to learn/validate the approach as quickly as possible. The teams are prioritising the Takeaway journey first, with Delivery being a fast follower. We are achieving this with two (soon to be three) teams working side by side on parallel scope - I am in the role of <strong>Acting Head of Design</strong> for the programme while helping Nandoâ€™s recruit for the internal position.</p>

                  <h3>Result</h3>
                  <p>Co-locating a multi-disciplinary team is allowing us to provide technical and strategic consulting services, and to recommend the best strategic approach to adding a takeaway and delivery journey to the current app. The programme of work is ongoing.</p>
